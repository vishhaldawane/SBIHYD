	Enterprise Applications has 7 features 
	because of these 7 features, it is known as enterprise application



		this is first feature, because it is first feature

	1. Remote capability 
	
		Networking - connectivity of machines


		java.net

		ServerMachine 	ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket();
		|serve - BankApplication
		|
		|    <--network is must
		|
		|request
		ClientMachine	Socket sock = new Socket();
		

	2. High Availability - HA 
		24 x 7
		365 days (including leap year)
		- 10 to 6 <-- as an employee

		- bank application 00:00 hours to 23:59 hours

		Clustering

			Server1	Server2	Server3	Server4

			
	3. Multithreading 

		- available to 100s,1000s, 100000s users


	4. Pooling of Resources
		- POOL - 
		COMMON RESOURCES TO ALL
		(REGISTRED/NON-registered)

		What is a framework?


		- semi-developed application

			- you develop your application on top of it.

		Spring is a f/w
		
		1. a local method - remote method

		2. a non transactional method - transactional method

		3. a non-threading method - a threading method

		4. a non pooled object - can be a pooled object

		5. a non cached object - can be a cached object

		6. a non secured method - can be a secured method

		- book two tickets for an aircraft
		1 for you and 1 for your glider

		and now your glider is now an aircraft

		To write a simple spring application!


		1. You make a maven project

		2. In maven (pom.xml) 
			declare the dependencies of spring libraries

		



		Machine1	Machine2	Machine3	Machine4
		Laptop		Branch		ClientSide	Onsite[UK]
		|		|		|		|
		Java 11		Java 15		Java 18		Java 20
		Oracle 11	Oracle 18	Oracle 21	Oracle 23
		Spring 4.5	Spring 5	Spring 5.3	Spring 5.9
		Hibernate 4.3	Hiberante 5	Hib 5.3		Hib 5.4
		Tomcat 8	Tomcat 9	Tomcat 10	Tomcat 11

		maven project---> pull it here--->
		|
		pom.xml	
		|
		declare 
		the dependencies
		(website/jar filename/version)
		-java 18
		-oracle 21
		-spring 5.3
		-hib 5.3
		-tom 10
		|
		downloaded on your
		local machine

	
		1. first look up at
			local repositories
		2. company server
			availed from here
		3. internet 
			maven central repositories

















		Spring PROJECT 


		1. make a  MAVEN project (style)
					(pom.xml)

		2. declare Spring libraries in the pom.xml
			spring core jar files

		3. make spring configuration file 
			declare the components/bean in it

		4. test the spring project
			make the objects of your beans


100% pure core java code
	
1. pom.xml  will have spring librariy dependency tag
2. myspring.xml - spring container configuration file
3. your test case to run the container

	SavingsAccount	




	Dependency Injection		Inversion Of Control IoC
	


	class SavingsAccount <-- Entity - identified by its PK
	{
		void withdraw(float amt) {
		
		}
		void deposit(float amt) {
		}
	}	

	class FundTransferService <-- the service class |  SERVICE LAYER
	{
		SavingsAccount source; <-- object to be ready | NULL
		SavingsAccount target; <-- NULL

		FundTransferService(SavingsAccount s, SavingsAccount t)
		{
			source=s; //initializing
			target=t; //initializing
		}
		void transferFunds(float amountToTransfer) {
			source.withdraw(amountToTransfer);
			target.deposit(amountToTransfer);
		}
	}

TEST CASES

	class TransferTest
	{
		void testCase1() {
		
			somebody is nothing but the spring container
			|
			your spring configuration xml file
			
			
			SavingsAccount source = sombody gives the object | new SavingsAccount(50000);
			SavingsAccount target = somebody gives the object | new SavingsAccount(4000);

			FundTransferService service = somebody gives the object | new FundTransferService(source,target);
			
			service.transferFunds(3000);
			
		}

operations
		
		1)result set data would be injected in the object of Department class

		2)and this department object would be added in the ArrayList

		3) repeat the step 1 and 2 until the last record of the table

		4) and show the array list output
